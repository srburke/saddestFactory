                            <p>MUNA is an American indie pop band consisting of lead singer/songwriter Katie Gavin, lead
                                guitarist
                                Josette Maskin, and guitarist/producer Naomi
                                McPherson. They released two studio albums with RCA Records, <i>About U (2017)</i> and
                                <i>Saves the World (2019)</i>, before signing to Saddest Factory Records, where their
                                third studio album, <i>MUNA (2022)</i> was released.

                                Since MUNA began making music together in college, at USC, they'd always
                                embraced pain as a bedrock of longing, a part of growing up, and an inherent factor of
                                marginalized experience. The band's self-titled third album
                                is an exquisite act of musical justice for those who suffered the indignities of growing
                                up queer in the Y2K era.

                                Garnering attention, they were invited to open for the Los Angeles-based duo The Marias,
                                where they continued to hone their voice, polishing a sound that combines dreampop with
                                late-'90s hooks. Nearly three years later at age 21, Claud, has released their first
                                full-length album

                                Jane as a three-piece punk band with Bridgers on Bass, Sarah Cath on Guitar, and Imogen

                                and about growing into yourself in the process.
