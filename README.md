# saddestFactory
Final Project, a mock website for the record label Saddest Factory using pure HTML/CSS.
- Pages Included:
  - Home
  - Artists
  - Tours
  - Discography
  - Videos

## Final Project Turnout
- As this was my first ever website I've created, there are some changes/updates I would like to do if I get back to this project.
  - Not use as many different fonts, and stick to three prominent colors
  - Change the theme to be more consistent throughout the pages since it's pretty inconsistent right now
  - Resize the paragraphs so that the text is more readable and user friendly
  - Add top padding to the artist description boxes
  - Change the positioning of the artists socials from being on the side to bottom of artist description box
